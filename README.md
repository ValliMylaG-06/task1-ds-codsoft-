ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects (Google Colab)

This repository contains three beginner-friendly data science and machine learning projects. All notebooks were developed and executed in Google Colab using popular Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

ðŸš¢ 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

Key Steps:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables)
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating `FamilySize`)
- Model building using:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
